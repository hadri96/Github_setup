# MAC Users

As MAC OS users, you already have most of what's needed to work with Github.

However, we do need to install a couple more things and to do that we need Homebrew.

**Homebrewüç∫** is a popular package manager for macOS and Linux that allows users to easily install and manage software packages and libraries from the command line. It simplifies the process of downloading, updating, and maintaining various software tools and utilities on a computer. If you want to understand more about it, feel free to visit their [website](https://brew.sh/).

To install Homebrew, run the following command on your Terminal

bash```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
