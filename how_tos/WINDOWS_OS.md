# WINDOWS OS setup

## Installing the Git CLI

For Windows users, things are a bit different as usual. To use Github, we rely a lot on the Terminal which is installed by default on Mac and Linux OS. However, Windows uses a different interface called the Command Prompt which is specific to Windows. This interface uses slightly different commands from the ones used in Bash-based interfaces which can be a bit of hindrance.

Thankfully, some folks decided to create the Git CLI for Windows(CLI=Command Line Interface) which is a Bash interface that already possesses the Github related functions, therefore you will to install it. You can find it [there](https://gitforwindows.org/).

This will allow you to have a similar experience as what Terminal users have with a minimal effort.

### Steps install the Git CLI

1. Download the .exe file.
2. Click on the file
3. During the installation process, you will be asked whether you want to **allow the application to make changes on your device**, please make sure to click on Yes (this is extremely important for later).
4. For the rest, you can simply use the default settings.
5. To find the app, you can just search for Git Bash into your menu and you will find it as Git Bash Desktop.

Congratulations, you now have a bash-based interface on your laptop!ðŸŽ‰

## Oh My Zsh set up (optional)

Before we move on to set up Github, we are also going to install Oh My Zsh on your machine. Oh My Zsh is a popular open-source framework that makes your command line on a computer more user-friendly and customizable by adding cool features and designs. It's like giving your computer's "talking" part a makeover.

However, like before, the fact that you have Windows might create a couple of little complications, however on this (link)[https://dominikrys.com/posts/zsh-in-git-bash-on-windows/] you will find a step-by-step list of instructions to set it up.

## Github setup

The first obvious step will be to create your own Github profile, you can register [there](https://github.com/signup?).

Once you are done with that, we are going to have to follow the steps on this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create and link your machine with your Github account.

This part might be a bit more challenging which is why we will complete it in class if you encounter troubles.
